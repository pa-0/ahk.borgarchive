# New Ideas
	Is the media player stuff in config worth keeping around? I don't really switch music programs anymore, and Chrome awkwardly tries to grab media keys anyway.
	Make Ctrl+Backspace work properly in EMC2 change-decision popups
		Title: Change Decision: Waiting for Changes
			Probably just use "Change Decision: "?
		Resubmit-type popups, too?
	Could the ActionObject* children just provide their own functions for testing if we think a given string matches them?
		Instead of trying to duplicate their logic in ActionObject itself
		Could we keep a static version of the actionObject TableList?
			Can we handle filtering properly?
			Seems like each child would need its own static copy if we want to do this
			Would need to add the ability to pass in a TableList instead of a filename/path (and handle issues with not having a path, like +e command)
		Does it really make sense to use a Selector to determine type? Should it just be a hard-coded function in each child instead?
			Benefit of using Selector: automatic abbreviation/"actual" ini handling (zqn/qan/q, etc.)
	Hotkey for automatically breaking up documentation lines to 100 chars wide
		Possibly reconsider the 100-char limit - wouldn't wider make more sense?
		Could take into account whether there would be only 1 small word moved down
		Could handle multiple line breaks
	Allow opening routines in EpicStudio in an environment other than DBC Dev (mainly to allow CDE)
		Probably a new (optional) data element throughout ActionObject* (and a new column in actionObject.tls)
	Consider changing the approach for hyperlinker a bit
		Have OneNote, others that need special handling do it themselves somehow
		Ideas:
			Passing in a BoundFunc
			Just having a function with the right name
				Would require a mapping from window name to class where function lives
			Have programs that need special handling call into the logic themselves and handle special logic
	EpicStudio - add a diffing hotkey that makes it easier to do the same diff to a bunch of different routines
		Could use existing ^d hotkey to get popup, then !e to focus environment and enter the chosen one
		Initial submission would involve a selector popup of environments
	Add some way to move windows where I want them
		Hotkey-triggered, for all windows in list?
		Maybe lean on monitor fixer script from before?
		Make sure monitor exists before putting a window there
		Spotify
			Switch to other monitor, then correct one
			At home: move to correct height (not cut off)
		Work
			KDiff window - maximize on center screen
			MatterMost - half of left screen
		Telegram - left monitor, top or bottom depending on machine
		Pidgin window - top-right of left monitor
	Figure out some central documentation method for hotkeys
		Dynamically pull hotkeys for the currently focused program?
		Hotkey to show popup with all currently active hotkeys, divided up into current-program-specific and others
			Maybe separate section for stuff that runs when some other window exists (media hotkeys, for example)
	
# Selector
	Re-examine SelectorGui/FlexTable - could we simplify out a lot of the extra logic using built-in Gui positioning options?
		https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Gui.htm#PosSize
			Gui, Margin + AutoSize to avoid needing to keep track of a total height/width for the popup
			wp/hp/x+n/y+n for sizing/positioning relative to last control
			x+m/y+m to use margin value
			xs/ys for "sections" - looks like I could use xs to start a new "row" (use the same X-value as the start of the "section")
				Can use +n/-n for these as well
		If I go through the trouble of doing this, also make index/abbreviation columns resize dynamically
			Would need some way to figure out the max width of all text that WILL BE in a given column
			OR: add all of one column, for the entire super-column, at once - then use xs+n to place the next column, etc.
	Dynamically resize abbreviation column based on widest value?
		To allow longer abbreviations
		Is that going to get weird with SelectorGui+FlexTable interactions?
	Consider adding a way to match on some other column than just NAME and ABBREV
		Use cases
			Transaction dump all script, to get name from epicEnvironments TLS instead of just using COMMID
	
# Toast
	Could we avoid flickering between .showPersistent() and .setText()?
		Maybe some way to set position without showing?
		It's kind of strange that .setText() shows the toast if it's hidden - could we avoid that, or is it required by Toast framework?
	Figure out how to deal with Toast/VisualWindow issue where upper-right toasts jump to the next monitor over
		Happens if they're anchored to right edge and then their text gets longer by enough.
		Looks like the issue is that we make the toast bigger enough that Windows decides it's on the next monitor
			We create a new VisualWindow each time we want to move the Toast
				Maybe we should have a persistent one instead?
			The actual resizing (via Gui, Show with AutoSize) happens in Toast.move()
				What if we create the VisualWindow earlier (before the AutoSize) and somehow use that to save off or anchor the Toast to the current monitor?
		When we fix this, we can update:
			iconTester.ahk - don't need a toast message up front, can be blank to start and we can just call switchToIconWithNum(0) instead of getting the text
			updateNotepadPPAHKSupport
