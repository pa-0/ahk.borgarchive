Review changes (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/v2-changes.htm):
	Language (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/v2-changes.htm#language):
		Legacy syntax removed (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/v2-changes.htm#legacy-syntax-removed):
			☐ All commands are now functions (drop the paren between command and params)
				☐ Can probably get rid of commandFunctions.ahk
			☐ All text now quoted
			☐ No more percent-sign-wrapped variables (except for #Include)
			☐ No more percent-sign prefix to force an expression
			☐ Throw exceptions (or return values) instead of setting ErrorLevel
			☐ Loop must be followed by another keyword (Files/Parse/Read/Reg), can't be quoted or a variable. Also no comma needed between.
			Gosub removed:
				☐ SetTimer and Hotkey now take function references instead
				☐ Use parameters instead of A_ThisLabel
				☐ Functions can go in the auto-execute section now!
		Hotkeys and (non-auto-replace) hotstrings now auto-define a (assume-local) function (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/v2-changes.htm#hotkey-and-hotstring-labels):
			☐ Multi-line hotkeys need braces to enclose the body of the hotkey instead of "return"
		Names (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/v2-changes.htm#names):
			☐ Func("MyFunc") => MyFunc
			☐ SetTimer/Hotkey passing "MyFunc" => pass MyFunc
			☐ Calling function by value: %myVar%() => myVar()
			☐ To call function using just its name, use a double-deref (%MyFunc%() - https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Variables.htm#deref)
				But: use function references instead of names if possible.
			☐ Built-in classes have changed: https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/ObjList.htm
				Will be important for my StringBase/ArrayBase/ObjectBase stuff
		Scope (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/v2-changes.htm#scope):
			☐ Super-global variables removed (except for built-in variables)
			☐ Functions can now read (but not write) global variables without declaring them
			☐ Force-local mode removed
			☐ GuiLib stuff with dynamic globals will need updates:
				☐ getLabelSizeForText
				☐ create/getDynamicGlobal()
			☐ Might be able to drop the "global varName" stuff at the start of a lot of standalone scripts' functions
			☐ Can probably get rid of pseudo-array handling in DataLib - convertPseudoArrayToArray, rebaseVariadicAry
		Variables (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/v2-changes.htm#variables):
			☐ Static variables now initialized on first use, instead of auto-executing
				☐ Probably means I can simplify a lot of property "build it if not set yet" stuff in Config and other status classes

		✔ Command Line (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/v2-changes.htm#command-line): @done(23-01-05 12:22)
			✔ Command line args are no longer a numbered pseudo-array, but a proper array in the A_Args built-in variable instead. @done(23-01-05 12:22)

Specific things to fix:
	☐ VDI setup
		☐ New installer
	☐ Switch command line arguments from numbered pseudo-array to use A_Args (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Variables.htm#Args) instead

New ideas possible with v2:
	☐ Better clipboard manipulation => sending RTF and/or HTML links directly with the clipboard
		ClipboardAll: https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/lib/ClipboardAll.htm
		Could replace my hyperlinking stuff - just get the text, build the link, and overwrite the original text with the link
