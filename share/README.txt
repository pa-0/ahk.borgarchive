Each script here was written (or modified/co-opted) by Gavin Borg, and is free for you to modify and use. Scripts have instructions for installation and use at the top of the file (just open in any text editor).

The scripts prefixed with "_" (an underscore) are not for general use, but are used to help create these scripts in the first place. You're welcome to look through them, though.

Note: All should have an emergency exit hotkey of CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+WIN+R that should exit all of these scripts running.
