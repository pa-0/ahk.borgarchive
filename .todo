# Fixes
	Seems like standalone scripts reload once on their own, then are restarted again by main script - should either have them not restart, or don't need main script to reload them too.
	Make server routine stuff work again (or ditch it entirely, or make only the web link work) for ActionObject.
	Fix monitor fixer script or get rid of it entirely.
	
# New ideas
	Add HDR as a thing we can open with ActionObject?
	Hotstring for making a new row in OneNote Do stuff
		Trim out/replace chars as needed based on INI: "[]:#"
			(Specifics page with specific formats per INI)
		Take care of linking (to record in string, at least), too?
			What about new specifics page? Separate hotstring that includes that as well?
		Remove "DBC" with whatever separator "-/\ " from start of title, since that's not particularly needed?
		Brainstormed logic:
			INI/ID
				Is first char [
					Yes
						ID is next characters up to the first ]
							(or: all chars in alphanumeric set used by epic.ahk > isEMC2Id)
						INI is unknown, ask user (via Selector popup?)
					No
						INI string is first string (not just 3 chars) up to first " " or "#"
							Run through selector for true INI, or ask user if not found there
						ID is remaining string (after delimiter from above) up until first ":" or "-"
							(or: all chars in alphanumeric set used by epic.ahk > isEMC2Id)
			Title
				Is SLG?
					Yes
						Trim off customer (chars up until first ":")
						Trim off responsible person (end of string back to the first "--" string, iff that string exists)
				Remainder of string
	Support just a single (associative array) argument for DEBUG.popup
		Could call like this:
			DEBUG.popup({"Label":value, "Label":value})
	Add something like VimBindings for Outlook?
		At least j/k and ;/p would be nice.
	VB6 - ^F2 focuses first dropdown
	New open-from-codesearch hotkey in Chrome - ^+o?
		Routine from title
		Tag from selection (or nothing, just open routine)
		Could also support line number highlight
			Probably overkill, though.
	Review activateProgram/runProgram framework - VB seems to always run even though it's activate, for example (though that's the desired behavior anyway).
	Standardize/clean up window functions
		Main functions (minimize, close, etc) should take these parameters:
			titleString (for identifying the window to apply action to, default to "A" for active)
			winSettings (for action/exe/class/title/etc. access as needed)
		processWindow
			Get rid of fillFromActive parameter
			Info fed to MainConfig.getWindow() comes from window identified by titleString (default to "A" for active)
				Safety quit if titleString is explitly blank?
			Update titleString (ByRef) if it's blank coming in
				Based on values that come from winSettings
		Switch the other functions in this file that use idString (generated from a titleString) to just use a titleString, no reason to have that step.
	Figure out auto-updating the running script when source saved, specifically for test.ahk
		Alternatively, just give it a different restart hotkey.
	Make it easier to get correct, drive-mapped paths
		Maybe when copy, check for epic:// and replace with correct drive letter accordingly?
		Actually, a custom paste might be better - don't want to modify the clipboard needlessly.
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
	Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
