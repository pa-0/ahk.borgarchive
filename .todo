# Fixes
	Make server routine stuff work again (or ditch it entirely, or make only the web link work) for ActionObject.
		Make web version be codesearch routine thing?
	Standardize formatting of vimBindings to match other standalone scripts.
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
	Document Selector settings passed in programmatically
	Selector - add new parameter (maybe to both entry points?) for column to return?
	
# New ideas
	Move commonHotkeys to something like autoinclude - no specific path that way.
	Add HDR as a thing we can open with ActionObject?
	VB6 - ^F2 focuses first dropdown
	Hotstring for making a new row in OneNote Do stuff
		Trim out/replace chars as needed based on INI: "[]:#"
			(Specifics page with specific formats per INI)
		Take care of linking (to record in string, at least), too?
			What about new specifics page? Separate hotstring that includes that as well?
		Remove "DBC" with whatever separator "-/\ " from start of title, since that's not particularly needed?
		Brainstormed logic:
			INI/ID
				Is first char [
					Yes
						ID is next characters up to the first ]
							(or: all chars in alphanumeric set used by epic.ahk > isEMC2Id)
						INI is unknown, ask user (via Selector popup?)
					No
						INI string is first string (not just 3 chars) up to first " " or "#"
							Run through selector for true INI, or ask user if not found there
						ID is remaining string (after delimiter from above) up until first ":" or "-"
							(or: all chars in alphanumeric set used by epic.ahk > isEMC2Id)
			Title
				Is SLG?
					Yes
						Trim off customer (chars up until first ":")
						Trim off responsible person (end of string back to the first "--" string, iff that string exists)
				Remainder of string
	Add something like VimBindings for Outlook?
		At least j/k and ;/p would be nice.
	New open-from-codesearch hotkey in Chrome - ^+o?
		Routine from title
		Tag from selection (or nothing, just open routine)
		Could also support line number highlight
			Probably overkill, though.
	Make it easier to get correct, drive-mapped paths
		Maybe when copy, check for epic:// and replace with correct drive letter accordingly?
		Actually, a custom paste might be better - don't want to modify the clipboard needlessly.
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
	Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
