# Fixes
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
		Build in selector for times
			Can have hard-coded list of choices to pass in
	Rewrite/clean up coding style for kdeMoverSizer
	Go through warnings that appear when #Warn is enabled in main
	Take another pass through Selector GUI stuff - seems like there's more options for positioning things now (https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Gui.htm#PosSize)
	Check out File.* methods for reading from file (https://autohotkey.com/docs/AHKL_ChangeLog.htm#v1.1.24.04)
	"idate" hotstring isn't working in Excel cells (though the formula bar is fine).
	SysGet function (vs command) - broke alt+drag snapping, centering hotkey
	
# New ideas
	Update all scripts to use the functional versions of commands that have output variables (functions in common\commandFunctions.ahk)
		Places to confirm before using:
			IniRead (don't we have ini.ahk to try out below?)
			Run (need to analyze a little more vs. my own wrappers)
	Search over uses of ErrorLevel and make sure we don't lose uses with new functional command replacements.
	Expand wrapper selection for things like these:
		WinGetExe
			ahkExe := WinGet("ProcessName", titleString)
	Move my own wrappers into a combined file with commandFunctions?
	Check out enumerator objects for use instead of constants? (https://autohotkey.com/docs/objects/Enumerator.htm)
	Add HDR as a thing we can open with ActionObject?
	Add some way to show progress for long-running scripts - maybe using a tooltip or something?
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
	Go through pukkandan's startup script (https://github.com/pukkandan/My-Startup-Script) and pull out anything interesting
		Lib
			INI - for my own INI reading/writing needs
			Toast - for displaying info with some hotkeys. Could be good for long-running stuff (like firstSetup)
		WinSizer - as a replacement/cross-pollination for KDE mover-sizer
		Directives - could be good to set some default settings for hotstrings and the like
			Move our directives into a file called directives.ahk?
			#Hotstring - default hotstring settings (his defaults: * ? B C K0 Z)
			#LTrim Off - don't left-trim continuation sections (like text that spans lines)
			#MenuMaskKey - what's this do? (he uses "{Ctrl}")
			Process, Priority, , R (high process priority)
			SetBatchLines, -1 				;Never sleep for best performance
			SetKeyDelay, 0, 0 				;Smallest possible delay
			SetMouseDelay, 0 				;Smallest possible delay
			SetDefaultMouseSpeed, 0 		;Move the mouse instantly
			SetWinDelay, 0 					;Smallest possible delay
			SetControlDelay, 0 				;Smallest possible delay
			;;StringCaseSense,Off			;Strings are not case-sensitive (DEFAULT?)
			SetTitleMatchMode - set this explicitly at beginning? (to 2 I think, but use constant)
			CoordMode - set the ones we want to use, explicitly
		Tray - to make main script (and all standalone scripts) have a consistent tray menu
			Probably similar to what I did in my own share scripts?
