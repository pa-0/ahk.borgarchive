# AHK To Do
	
	'Fixes'
		EMC2 check needs to be more granular - check ahk_exe as well as title.
		Fix setup - still doing zips and such. :\
	
	'New ideas'
		Move specificication of placeholder char for INIs to setting in INI itself
			In order to do this, we need to move processing of (at least some) +settings to TableList.
		Do we really need processOverride anymore, or is mergeArrays() what we really want, and better?
		Change selector/tableList INIs to a new extension - .tl, maybe?
		Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
			Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
		Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
