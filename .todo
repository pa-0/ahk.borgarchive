# Fixes
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
		Build in selector for times
			Can have hard-coded list of choices to pass in
	Rewrite/clean up coding style for kdeMoverSizer
	Go through warnings that appear when #Warn is enabled in main
	Take another pass through Selector GUI stuff - seems like there's more options for positioning things now (https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Gui.htm#PosSize)
	Check out File.* methods for reading from file (https://autohotkey.com/docs/AHKL_ChangeLog.htm#v1.1.24.04)
	
# New ideas
	Encapsulate scriptHotkeyType stuff in a function?
		Would mainly set an (explicitly) global variable
			Would match the read in this way (global declared in function)
	Trim down SelectorRow - it has a lot of unused arguments in its constructor.
	Looks like EXCLUDE_BLANKS in Selector is unused - trim out?
	Move findTrueFilePath to TableList or make it standalone?
	Add HDR as a thing we can open with ActionObject?
	Add some way to show progress for long-running scripts - maybe using a tooltip or something?
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
