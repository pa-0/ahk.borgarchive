# AHK To Do
	
	'Fixes'
		EMC2 check needs to be more granular - check ahk_exe as well as title.
	
	'New ideas'
		Move specificication of placeholder char for INIs to setting in INI itself
			In order to do this, we need to move processing of (at least some) +settings to TableList.
		Do we really need processOverride anymore, or is mergeArrays() what we really want, and better?
		Change selector/tableList INIs to a new extension - .tl, maybe?
		Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
			Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
		Expand debug to have a yes/no choice (or just take MsgBox options in general)
			Maybe a settings array as argument
				A simple "Continue?" with yes/no option
				Could be at beginning or end - would need something special to tell what it was, though.
					Maybe a special subscript set?
		Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
		Expand ^+t shortcut for logging into HS - selector of different destinations?
			Would probably use all = stuff
				Though maybe not? Could potentially wait for the user to pick a patient, then continue (WinWait, look out for cancel case, etc).
