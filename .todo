# Fixes
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
		Build in selector for times
			Can have hard-coded list of choices to pass in
	Rewrite/clean up coding style for kdeMoverSizer
	Go through warnings that appear when #Warn is enabled in main
	Check whether we have our own min/max functions, possibly replace with new built-in ones (https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Math.htm#Min)
	For standalone scripts, take a look at A_Args to see if it would be cleaner than using %1% and the like (https://autohotkey.com/docs/Variables.htm#Args)
	Update tray icon and global hotkeys to make use of A_IsSuspended instead of a custom "suspended" variable?
		Remember to retain custom ability somehow with vimBindings
	Consider making scriptHotkeyType stuff explicitly global
		On the one hand, more explicit
		On the other hand, fewer "global"s if we just put it in the place that reads the variable?
		On the other hand, does it really need to be a super-global?
	Possibly try Send, {Text} for raw clipboard sending (instead of SendRaw), might be more reliable (https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm#SendText)
		Also T option for hotstrings (if applicable at all)
	Check out File.* methods for reading from file (https://autohotkey.com/docs/AHKL_ChangeLog.htm#v1.1.24.04)
	
# New ideas
	Add HDR as a thing we can open with ActionObject?
	Add some way to show progress for long-running scripts - maybe using a tooltip or something?
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
