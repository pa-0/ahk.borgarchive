# AHK To Do
	
	'Fixes'
		Seems like standalone scripts reload once on their own, then are restarted again by main script - should either have them not restart, or don't need main script to reload them too.
		Make server routine stuff work again (or ditch it entirely, or make only the web link work) for ActionObject.
	
	'New ideas'
		Window sizing/positioning offsets - separate left/right/top/bottom
			Dynamically figure out which side the taskbar is on, so we can handle that regardless of where it is?
		Clean up window stuff for special behaviors - processWindow is way overcomplex.
		Figure out auto-updating the running script when source saved, specifically for test.ahk
		Check out function objects for selector action stuff: https://autohotkey.com/docs/objects/Functor.htm
		Make it easier to get correct, drive-mapped paths
			Maybe when copy, check for epic:// and replace with correct drive letter accordingly?
			Actually, a custom paste might be better - don't want to modify the clipboard needlessly.
		Snapper supports URLs as well - add support for that to ActionObject?
			Also include support for multiple things - maybe add that in general too?
				Also support newline separation (though likely just turn it into comma-separated for a consistent format).
		Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
			Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
		Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
		Turn the "; Special programs/specific params." section in launch.ahk into a parameter to activate/run program?
			Or maybe stick the quotes in the config somehow?
		Expand emulator controller to support other systems, perhaps?
			At least separate general form (loop + joybuttons) from specific meanings?
		Rework kdeMoverSizer to bring it up to my own coding style?
