# Fixes
	Take another look at genericSearch(), make sure we really need to do the forceArray() stuff
		Probably tweak the loop or pull out a subfunction, too.
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
		Build in selector for times
			Can have hard-coded list of choices to pass in
	Rewrite/clean up coding style for kdeMoverSizer
	
# New
	Rename private repo to ahk-private, since we're planning to add another repo (for OneTastic macros)
	Add some sort of safety to TLG selector - if we're not sending the info to Outlook, put it on the clipboard instead.
	Can we make Alt+Shift+X hotkey blocking in notepad++ (in main script) contingent on whether the test script is running?
	Consider properties instead of getter functions for selector stuff (at least SelectorRow?)
	Figure out some central documentation method
		Dynamically pull hotkeys for the currently focused program?
		Hotkey to show window with all currently active hotkeys, divided up into current-program-specific and others
			Maybe separate section for stuff that runs when some other window exists (media hotkeys, for example)
	Add some way to move windows where I want them
		Hotkey-triggered, for all windows in list?
		Maybe lean on monitor fixer script from before?
		Make sure monitor exists before putting a window there
		Spotify
			Switch to other monitor, then correct one
			At home: move to correct height (not cut off)
		Work
			KDiff window - maximize on center screen
		Telegram - left monitor, top or bottom depending on machine
		Pidgin window - top-right of left monitor
	Build a way to auto-reformat .tl files?
		Fix widths so they work nicely
			Will need to have a tab width parameter/argument somewhere for this (maybe in _constants or config?)
		Take into account overflow (across columns), with next field being empty or placeholder'd
