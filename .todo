# AHK To Do
	
	'Fixes'
		Have centering hotkey take height of taskbar into account?
		ActionObject.process - needs* variables don't exist, but we're using them?
		Finish cleaning up recent rough changes
			Snapper URL stuff
		Seems like standalone scripts reload once on their own, then are restarted again by main script - should either have them not restart, or don't need main script to reload them too.
	
	'New ideas'
		Figure out auto-updating the running script when source saved, specifically for test.ahk
		Check out function objects for selector action stuff: https://autohotkey.com/docs/objects/Functor.htm
		MainConfig - turn loadSettings() stuff into an inner function called however many times, not a loop over an array of settings.
		Debug - why are there two different build string functions, again?
		Debug - make a debug "builder" that stores off number of tabs and whatever last argument is?
		Make it easier to get correct, drive-mapped paths
			Maybe when copy, check for epic:// and replace with correct drive letter accordingly?
		Snapper supports URLs as well - add support for that to ActionObject?
			Also include support for multiple things - maybe add that in general too?
				Also support newline separation (though likely just turn it into comma-separated for a consistent format).
		Alt+drag has some interesting quirks with certain programs (just OneNote on Win10 so far?)
			Add to framework, new column in programs.tl?
			Looks like it's other office programs as well - at least Outlook has it bad.
		Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
			Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
		Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
		Turn the "; Special programs/specific params." section in launch.ahk into a parameter to activate/run program?
			Or maybe stick the quotes in the config somehow?
		Expand emulator controller to support other systems, perhaps?
			At least separate general form (loop + joybuttons) from specific meanings?
