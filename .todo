'Selector'
	Rework SelectorChoice
		Remove unused: userInput, buildSelectorChoice()
		Can we split constructor into two separate things?
			Array version, individual values + data version
		Reintroduce .name and .abbrev (as properties)
			In constructor, should come from either parameters (if given) or from "NAME"/"ABBREV" subscripts of data array
			Have launchSelectorPopup() use .name/.abbrev instead of .data["NAME"]/.data["ABBREV"]
	Rework Selector documentation
	Re-implement debug, but only for getting result of selection out
		Also make sure edit option is still passing back blank.
	
'Fixes'
	Possible bug: if more hidden choices than choices in Selector, could pick hidden choice by index (that are beyond the length of visible choices)?
	Take another look at genericSearch(), make sure we really need to do the forceArray() stuff
		Probably tweak the loop or pull out a subfunction, too.
	Go back and clean up launch.ahk a bunch with all of the additional logic dumped there from the selector rework
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
		Build in selector for times
			Can have hard-coded list of choices to pass in
	Rewrite/clean up coding style for kdeMoverSizer
	
'New'
	Should we have windows > activateProgram wait for window to be active after running?
		Possibly activate it itself after a timer if it's not active but exists?
	Selector of current DLGs?
		Could move PRJ stuff to this as well.
		Alternatively, could keep this in the TLG TL too?
			Could add a filter column (set by mod) for specifics section that has DLGs/PRJs
	Make a kind of snippet list for EpicStudio
		Selector with different kinds of loops (zoID,zoDAT,various index versions, etc.), and override fields for iterator variable, levels down, etc.
		Similar to for loop hotstring
	Find a better way to keep AHK todo list?
		This technically works, but it's weird to have to do commits just to record ideas to do.
		Ideas:
			Third-party, syncing todo app
			Put it in the private repo (hosted on home server)?
		Possibly also make syntax highlighting nicer: http://www.gottabegarabi.com/blog/todo-a-simple-todo-list-color-scheme-for-notepad/
			Would want to figure out how to add collapsing/expanding based on indentation (like Python, which is current thing I use).
	Use toast (or tooltip if that doesn't work out) to show when something was copied to clipboard by a hotkey
		OneNote page link, Chrome title copy, various Test copies (instead of popup)
	Make keypresses (maybe just Space?) delay OneNote page copying logic (so I can make it wait until new page appears), 1 second at a time?
	Link for Onenote, that if there's an ID in the "Investigation - QAN # [edit]" string, puts in both links (QAN # gets web, edit gets edit)
	Make a smaller subset of scripts that can run in VDIs?
		AHK is already installed (and latest version at that!)
	Centralize format-as-code hotkey (^+c) like we did for hyperlinking selected text?
	Add some way to show progress for long-running scripts - maybe using a tooltip, or toast library from below?
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
	Go through pukkandan's startup script (https://github.com/pukkandan/My-Startup-Script) and pull out anything interesting
		Lib
			Toast - for displaying info with some hotkeys. Could be good for long-running stuff (like firstSetup)
		WinSizer - as a replacement/cross-pollination for KDE mover-sizer
		Tray - to make main script (and all standalone scripts) have a consistent tray menu
			Probably similar to what I did in my own share scripts?
	Build a way to auto-reformat .tl files?
		Fix widths so they work nicely
			Will need to have a tab width parameter/argument somewhere for this (maybe in _constants or config?)
		Take into account overflow, with next field being empty or placeholder'd
	
'Documentation'
	Debug
	Selector
		Settings passed in programmatically
	MainConfig and windows.tl support for RegEx in titles ({REGEX})
