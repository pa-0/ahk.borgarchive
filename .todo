# Fixes
	Make server routine stuff work again (or ditch it entirely, or make only the web link work) for ActionObject.
		Make web version be codesearch routine thing?
	Standardize formatting of vimBindings to match other standalone scripts.
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
	Document Selector settings passed in programmatically
	Selector - add new parameter (maybe to both entry points?) for column to return?
	
# New ideas
	Add snapper URL launching for multiple records from within snapper itself
	Add some way to show progress for long-running scripts - maybe using a tooltip or something?
	Add HDR as a thing we can open with ActionObject?
	New open-from-codesearch hotkey in Chrome - ^+o?
		Routine from title
		Tag from selection (or nothing, just open routine)
		Could also support line number highlight
			Probably overkill, though.
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
	Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
