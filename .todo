# Fixes
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
		Build in selector for times
			Can have hard-coded list of choices to pass in
	Rewrite/clean up coding style for kdeMoverSizer
	
# New ideas
	Split up common folder, into classes and groups of functions
	Add HDR as a thing we can open with ActionObject?
	Add some way to show progress for long-running scripts - maybe using a tooltip or something?
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
	
# Scripts to Share
