# AHK To Do
	
	'Fixes'
		Make sure that actionObject path still works correctly (switched placeholder from \x to -)
	
	'New ideas'
		Universal opener/linker - make it easier to pick view-only version?
			Field that allows just "v" instead of full "VIEW"?
			dv, etc shortcuts?
		Condense more global constants into constants.ahk
			May need to move up in includeCommon.ahk, to before mainConfig.ahk?
		Move specificication of placeholder char for INIs to setting in INI itself
			In order to do this, we need to move processing of (at least some) +settings to TableList.
		Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
			Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
		Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
