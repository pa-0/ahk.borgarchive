# Fixes
	Take another look at genericSearch(), make sure we really need to do the forceArray() stuff
		Probably tweak the loop or pull out a subfunction, too.
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
		Build in selector for times
			Can have hard-coded list of choices to pass in
	Rewrite/clean up coding style for kdeMoverSizer
	
# New
	New ListConverter class/handler?
		Auto-detect input type, can get out different type
			Comma-separated
			Newline-separated
			Double-newline separated? (row in a onenote table)
		Used by new functions or something
			Selector to pick type of output
				Comma-separated
				Newline separated
				Override field for additional texts before/after each entry
					Could be used to output lists of IDs into EpicStudio (surrounding array, maybe dots for indentation, etc.)
		Example usage: whatever input (onenote table column or row) > comma-separated list usable for Snapper multi-record-launching
	Allow opening routines in EpicStudio in an environment other than DBC Dev (allow CDE)
		Options:
			New column in actionObject.tl for environment (would also allow us to expand codesearch routine option)
			New type of codesearch type with separate branch in ActionObject (not ideal)
	Can we make Alt+Shift+X hotkey blocking in notepad++ (in main script) contingent on whether the test script is running?
	Can we make our folder hotstrings more reliable?
		Send with clipboard?
		SendMode stuff?
			Sounds like SendInput/SendPlay should be uninterruptible
				But the fact that other scripts have a keyboard hook installed (because they're persistent, it looks like?) means we fall back to SendEvent?
				As such, "SendMode, Input" isn't doing anything for me at all right now.
			SendPlay seems to often leave behind the first char or two of the typed hotstring instead of getting rid of all of it
	Consider properties instead of getter functions for selector stuff (at least SelectorRow?)
	Figure out some central documentation method
		Dynamically pull hotkeys for the currently focused program?
		Hotkey to show window with all currently active hotkeys, divided up into current-program-specific and others
			Maybe separate section for stuff that runs when some other window exists (media hotkeys, for example)
	Add some way to move windows where I want them
		Hotkey-triggered, for all windows in list?
		Maybe lean on monitor fixer script from before?
		Make sure monitor exists before putting a window there
		Spotify
			Switch to other monitor, then correct one
			At home: move to correct height (not cut off)
		Work
			KDiff window - maximize on center screen
		Telegram - left monitor, top or bottom depending on machine
		Pidgin window - top-right of left monitor
	Build a way to auto-reformat .tl files?
		Fix widths so they work nicely
			Will need to have a tab width parameter/argument somewhere for this (maybe in _constants or config?)
		Take into account overflow (across columns), with next field being empty or placeholder'd
