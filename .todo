# Fixes
	Seems like standalone scripts reload once on their own, then are restarted again by main script - should either have them not restart, or don't need main script to reload them too.
	Make server routine stuff work again (or ditch it entirely, or make only the web link work) for ActionObject.
	Fix monitor fixer script or get rid of it entirely.
	
# New ideas
	OneNote copying link on home computer copies two links - have copy hotkey trim to only the onenote: one.
		Seems just newline-separated.
	Review activateProgram/runProgram framework - VB seems to always run even though it's activate, for example (though that's the desired behavior anyway).
	Standardize window functions
		Take a titleString instead of classes, EXEs, etc
		Turn that titleString into an ID and make an idString (ahk_id %winId%)
		Use the idString instead of titleString
	Update SelectorAction code style/formatting to be more standardized
	Clean up window stuff for special behaviors - processWindow is way overcomplex.
	Figure out auto-updating the running script when source saved, specifically for test.ahk
		Alternatively, just give it a different restart hotkey.
	Check out function objects for selector action stuff: https://autohotkey.com/docs/objects/Functor.htm
	Make it easier to get correct, drive-mapped paths
		Maybe when copy, check for epic:// and replace with correct drive letter accordingly?
		Actually, a custom paste might be better - don't want to modify the clipboard needlessly.
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
	Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
	Turn the "; Special programs/specific params." section in launch.ahk into a parameter to activate/run program?
		Or maybe stick the quotes in the config somehow?
