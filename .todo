# Fixes
	Seems like standalone scripts reload once on their own, then are restarted again by main script - should either have them not restart, or don't need main script to reload them too.
	Make server routine stuff work again (or ditch it entirely, or make only the web link work) for ActionObject.
	Fix monitor fixer script or get rid of it entirely.
	Make Chrome program checks more specific (ahk_exe instead of class, probably?)
		Other things use the same class - GitHub desktop, Discord, etc.
	Make selectors work from PuTTY - by not sending ^c to get selected text.
		Program-level exclusion where we assume it's already on the clipboard?
	
# New ideas
	Hotstring for making a new row in OneNote Do stuff
		Trim out/replace chars as needed based on INI: "[]:#"
			(Specifics page with specific formats per INI)
		Take care of linking (to record in string, at least), too?
			What about new specifics page? Separate hotstring that includes that as well?
		Remove "DBC" with whatever separator "-/\ " from start, since that's not particularly needed?
	Support just a single (associative array) argument for DEBUG.popup
		Could call like this:
			DEBUG.popup({"Label":value, "Label":value})
	Add something like VimBindings for Outlook?
		At least j/k and ;/p would be nice.
	VB6 - ^F2 focuses first dropdown
	New open-from-codesearch hotkey in Chrome - ^+o?
		Routine from title
		Tag from selection (or nothing, just open routine)
		Could also support line number highlight
			Probably overkill, though.
	Review activateProgram/runProgram framework - VB seems to always run even though it's activate, for example (though that's the desired behavior anyway).
	Standardize window functions
		Take a titleString instead of classes, EXEs, etc
		Turn that titleString into an ID and make an idString (ahk_id %winId%)
		Use the idString instead of titleString
		Add support for ahk_exe instead of just class - would make Discord/Chrome confusion easier to fix.
	Clean up window stuff for special behaviors - processWindow is way overcomplex.
	Figure out auto-updating the running script when source saved, specifically for test.ahk
		Alternatively, just give it a different restart hotkey.
	Check out function objects for selector action stuff: https://autohotkey.com/docs/objects/Functor.htm
	Make it easier to get correct, drive-mapped paths
		Maybe when copy, check for epic:// and replace with correct drive letter accordingly?
		Actually, a custom paste might be better - don't want to modify the clipboard needlessly.
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
	Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
