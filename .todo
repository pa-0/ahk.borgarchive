# Fixes
	Make server routine stuff work again (or ditch it entirely, or make only the web link work) for ActionObject.
		Make web version be codesearch routine thing?
	Standardize formatting of vimBindings to match other standalone scripts.
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
	Document Selector settings passed in programmatically
	Selector - add new parameter (maybe to both entry points?) for column to return?
	
# New ideas
	Go through RegExReplace calls and reconsider whether we should use StrReplace instead.
	Move commonHotkeys to something like autoinclude - no specific path that way.
	Add HDR as a thing we can open with ActionObject?
	Hotstring for making a new row in OneNote Do stuff
		Can we grab it from the title of chrome window?
			Hotkey to copy title from chrome (maybe excluding the "- Google Chrome" bit), then can just use new one to go from clipboard
		Take care of linking (to record in string, at least), too?
			What about new specifics page? Separate hotstring that includes that as well?
	Add something like VimBindings for Outlook?
		At least j/k and ;/p would be nice.
	New open-from-codesearch hotkey in Chrome - ^+o?
		Routine from title
		Tag from selection (or nothing, just open routine)
		Could also support line number highlight
			Probably overkill, though.
	Make it easier to get correct, drive-mapped paths
		Maybe when copy, check for epic:// and replace with correct drive letter accordingly?
		Actually, a custom paste might be better - don't want to modify the clipboard needlessly.
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
	Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
