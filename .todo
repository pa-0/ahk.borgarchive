# AHK To Do
	
	'Fixes'
		Have centering hotkey take height of taskbar into account?
	
	'New ideas'
		Snapper supports URLs as well - add support for that to ActionObject?
		Add to vimKeys - modification for twitter like -> m key
		Clean up vimKeys stuff - should really make a separate function for whether in super mode (if even used anymore?).
		Alt+drag has some interesting quirks with certain programs (just OneNote on Win10 so far?)
			Add to framework, new column in programs.tl?
		Condense more global constants into constants.ahk
			May need to move up in includeCommon.ahk, to before mainConfig.ahk?
		Resizing windows - add optional param to also center the newly resized window?
		Move specificication of placeholder char for INIs to setting in INI itself
			In order to do this, we need to move processing of (at least some) +settings to TableList.
		Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
			Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
		Have remote desktop script mute volume on a loop, or whenever a new connection is made.
		Universal opener/linker - make it easier to pick view-only version?
			Field that allows just "v" instead of full "VIEW"?
			dv, etc shortcuts?
