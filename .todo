# Fixes
	Make server routine stuff work again (or ditch it entirely, or make only the web link work) for ActionObject.
		Make web version be codesearch routine thing?
	Update or get rid of timer - formatting, general code cleanup, even functionality?
		Build in selector for times
			Can have hard-coded list of choices to pass in
	
# New ideas
	Phase out separate script of startup logic - just set input lock states directly in main, and toggle them in commonHotkeys.
	Split up common folder, into classes and groups of functions
	Add snapper back as a way to link/run things
		Could make links this way too
	Add some way to show progress for long-running scripts - maybe using a tooltip or something?
	Add HDR as a thing we can open with ActionObject?
	New open-from-codesearch hotkey in Chrome - ^+o?
		Routine from title
		Tag from selection (or nothing, just open routine)
		Could also support line number highlight
			Probably overkill, though.
	Audit all scripts for unused hotkeys
		Come up with centralized (or something that reads scripts and creates one) documentation of hotkeys?
